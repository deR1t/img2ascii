# img2ascii

I made this because I needed BIG ascii art, uploaded it here because why not.

Oh, and it supports YWOT pasting if you have chromedriver installed somewhere!

## Known bugs:
• If the art is about 1024 characters wide, it wraps. Don't know how to fix it, I blame microsoft haha.

## TODO feature list:
• Dithering

• Text generator

• Change the display font

• Don't use textbox to display the text, use like skiasharp or something and draw it manually
